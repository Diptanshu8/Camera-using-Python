# Camera-using-Python
Using webcam,python script and raspberry pi to design security camera

#Motivation
I am a raspberry pi enthusiast and wanted to give a try to camera usage with raspberry pi.
So this script came into existence where it generates a snap of the camera view once it is run. 
USERS MAY PUT IT TO THEIR DESIRED USAGE. IT WORKS !

#Requirements
1. pygame
2. python 2.7+

#Installation notes
Once you are done setting up python 2.7+ and pygame, clone this repo and edit the script for the camera location shown by your raspberry pi (might be "lsusb" or "dmesg" helps you) <in my case the camera location was /dev/video0>. Then run the script to get a snap !
